The maze has you get a key from a scary growling bear and then use the key to go through  a door to eventually find the win zone. 
You can see the screencast video here: https://youtu.be/D1ILVTttfRo

One thing to note is I am using spatial audio the bear growls louder as you get closer.

Probably the challenge I had was getting the teleport smooth, as it would flicker when doing other raycasting.

I used some paid packages for the decor and the spatial audio feature

I used SoundToolkit to do spatial audio: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/audio/soundtoolkit-136305

I used Art gallery Vol.3 - exhibition hall for the walls ceilings and some decor:
